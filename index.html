      <h2>Project 1: Register File</h2>
      <p>
        This week, we finalized a schedule to ensure that we complete the entirety of the CPU by July 31st. We have also decided that we will be creating it with the Von Neumann architecture, meaning our program instructions and data will be stored in the same memory. The Von Neumann architecture is used more commonly in general-purpose computers which is why we chose it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first component that we will be creating for our CPU is the register file which is a collection of registers, which are small, fast memory storage units.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this module is the first part of our CPU, we have set the inputs and outputs to be placeholders for when we combine all the modules together in Vivado. For now, we set it so that you can select which of the 8 registers you want to update by changing the 3 far right switches on the FPGA board. Since 2^3 = 8, this creates a total of 8 combinations for 8 different registers. You can select which register you want to write to by pressing button BTNU on the board.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use the switches, SW7-SW0, to create an 8 bits of data for the register selected (on -> 1. off -> 0). You can then press button BTNC to write that data into the selected register.
      </p>
      <p>
        To read what each register’s data holds, we set it to always display the data onto the on-board LEDs. You can cycle through the registers within the register file by pressing button BTNL to see what data each of the eight registers hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, all of these manual instructions won’t exist on our final CPU. These are just to serve the purpose of testing whether the code does what we want, and act as placeholders for when we complete the other modules that connect to the register file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main takeaways we took from this project was more foundational skills in Verilog, including an understanding of how top modules function, acting as a central point for connecting submodules. By committing to a Von Neumann architecture and ensuring our code will be compatible with future submodules, we developed a stronger grasp of CPU design.

      <h2>Pre-Project: 8-Bit Counter</h2>
      <p>
        We began learning how to program the Basys 3 in Verilog with Vivado. While Vivado serves as an excellent IDE to both generate bitstreams, resolve syntax errors, and program the Basys 3, it is a sizable application. We aim to discover and understand its many applications in the following projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first goal was to create a simple 8-bit counter. For this project, the Basys 3 would count in binary by using the built-in LEDs, on for 1 and off for 0. Below is our completed project:
      </p>
      <img src="images/8bitcounter.gif" alt="8 bit counter gif">
      <p>
        <b>Hurdles</b><br />Prior to completing the 8 bit counter, we were having difficulties with both hardware and software. Below, we detail the obstacles we faced and how we addressed them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unable to program device<br />One of our initial obstacles when beginning our project was being unable to program the Basys 3. We generated a bitstream without issue, our code had no syntax errors, but Vivado was simply unable to find a hardware target (the Basys 3), even when plugged in. However, through the Windows Device Manager, we were able to determine that the Basys 3 was not recognized under the Universal Serial Bus controllers. This was found to be true for other devices that were connected with the cable. So our issue lied in the cable itself, which did not support data transfer. Switching to a USB cable that did support data transfer solved this issue.</li>
        <li>Clock not functioning concerns<br />In order to have the 8 bit counter work in real time, we needed the leds to update in intervals. With our first 8 bit counter code not updating on the board, we believed that there may have been some internal problems with the FPGAs oscillator. Just to make sure, we broke our code down into parts and checked the functionality of the clock by making a simple led blink. Through trial and error, we eventually realized that the clock was working just fine, it was only a problem in our code that we had to work around. In our first iteration, we assigned “output reg” for our leds. In our final iteration, we separated it into “output” for the leds, and “reg” for a separate variable that would store the count, and then in the end, we would set led to equal that count. Through this method, we were able to see the led blinking, thus making sure the clock was working.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here, you can see the blinking led on LD7 (to test the clock), the dim led on LD6 (to test the led's usability), and the switch on SW0 (to test a switch):

      <h2>AMD Vivado Design Suite</h2>
      <p>
        The software that we will be using to program our FPGA board is the Vivado Standard Edition 2024.2 which fully supports the Basys 3 Artix-7 board.
      </p>
      <p>
        We finished downloading the software yesterday and are currently learning about the interface through AMD's documentation page: <a href="https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug893-vivado-ide/Using-the-Viewing-Environment" target="_blank">link</a>

      <h2>The FPGA development board</h2>
      <p>
        We are using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) board to create our CPU in Verilog. The FPGA board that we acquired is the Digilent Basys 3 Artix-7 Trainer Board. Today, that board arrived! Here is the Amazon page where we bought it from: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digilent-Basys-Artix-7-Trainer-Board/dp/B00NUE1WOG?crid=5JVY3OPXM1O&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qMlRtlhowmLl3EX-DpUbq7Ac3i1ZD7f9m67IDbv7zpMHA85ce4mYWUKdn3uy-odUrmFNWhWobRB2lJHc9MeqO82LU21jL-nVTs4tRIWkG3g4nzbFrPihi2LnPnGidW5ztUub0qPUMIKZIo6sfjpg57R5LVehG-s1PVmucSoheiqT6H1abzKNKdwfB134_PGNKH2Kz9bUHf-uuICAqxhDflv1uvGLi2XXhjt7qI4v6mhYaExvif7RXwIW5L2RIsV4uwPQi_cuZ7y3iamI1Px2_iT758Y8ptjugq23y5iuTMw.2fxgJoLtajdXujPhdiMxQfwtegUW3fUM1R6miNdUbM8&dib_tag=se&keywords=basis+3&qid=1747861595&sprefix=%2Caps%2C623&sr=8-1" target="_blank">link</a>

      <h2>Creation of the Blog</h2>
      <p>
        During the summer of 2025, Ehan Masud and Ayan Masud plan on creating an 8-bit CPU. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We created this blog to log the progress we make, reflect on challenges we face, and share what we learn along the way. Documenting what we do helps us stay organized, and may help other students attempting similar projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether we succeed or run into errors, this blog will serve as both a technical journal and a means to connect with people interested in computer architecture and DIY electronics.
